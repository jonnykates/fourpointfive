# Four Point Five
Four Point Five is a tool to help developers make their websites and applications more accessible. It calculates the contrast ratio between two colours and tells you whether you meet the WCAG's AA criteria of a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

Unlike many other similar tools, Four Point Five will then automatically calculate the nearest passing colour to use should you fail to meet the 4.5:1 benchmark.
